##Darts Scoreboard 

Command line interface for 2 players to play a game of darts. 

The script asks for the names of the two players first, followed by input fields for subsequent scores. The scores from three dart throws must be inputted in csv (comma seperated) format. At the end of each round the value needed by each player to 'checkout' of the game is also displayed, along with the current total score. 

#Known issues 
1. When scoring input is not comma seperated properly, the totalled scored and checkout scores are wrong (sometimes negative)
